# Raycaster
This is my first attempt at creating a raycaster and was created as part of my "Intro to Computer Graphics I" course
at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities.

To use the raycaster, a terminal should be opened to the wanted version's directory. Then, compile it by typing "make".
Finally, the raycaster can be run by typing "./raycaster 'input file' 'output file'" where 'input file' is an input
.txt file and 'output file' is the desired name of the output .ppm file.
Example: ./raycaster input.txt out.ppm
